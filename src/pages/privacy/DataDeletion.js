      <h2>Individual Rights</h2>
      <p>
        An individual has the right to erasure, also known as ‘the right to be
        forgotten’. The principle underpinning this right is to enable an
        individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where
        there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.
      </p>
      <h2>When does the right to erasure apply?</h2>
      <p>
        Individuals have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent
        processing in specific circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the
          purpose for which it was originally collected/processed;
        </li>
        <li>When the individual withdraws consent;</li>
        <li>
          When the individual objects to the processing and there is no other
          legal ground for the relevant processing activity;
        </li>
        <li>
          Where the personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a
          legal obligation.
        </li>
        <h2>How can data be deleted</h2>
